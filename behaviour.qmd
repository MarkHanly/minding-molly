# Behaviour

## At home
Molly is a very good girl at home and between her morning and evening walks will spend most of the day asleep. She generally won't bark at passers-by, doorbells etc (and we sternly tell her "no barking" if she ever does). She does like to sit in a comfy spot and at home she is allowed on the couch but she knows she has to be "on your blanket". She likes a little snuggle in the morning and evening and she has an inbuilt alarm clock set to 5pm for evening walks. She doesn't counter surf or chew things (apart from her toys).

## Being left alone
Molly is fine to be left alone in the home and will usually just sleep on our bed when we are out during the day. As a puppy she would get anxious and whine when we left her alone but we got through that by following some common advice, which we recommend:

* Give her some time to get comfortable in a new space before leaving her alone
* Make sure she is toileted, fed, and exercised before leaving
* Don't make a fuss when leaving, just say "Molly, mind the house"
* Don't make a fuss when returning - we will usually completely ignore her for a minute before saying hello with a treat. 

## With other people

Molly is generally great with other people and will sometimes want to stop and say hello to people on walks. If she gets too excited she might try to jump up to say hello (we discourage this and say "no jumping"). She is always very gentle with children. 

## With other dogs
The main behavioural issue to be aware of is with other dogs. Below are scenarios to be aware of where Molly can snap or be reactive: 

* If a dog approaches her while she is playing with her ball (this is a real trigger so please avoid playing with the ball around other dogs)

* If another on-leash dog barks or lunges towards her while out walking

* If you sitting at a cafe or outdoor seating area and another dog is too much in your space. Molly would be fine meeting the same dog out walking; it seems to be the sitting/resting that makes her disposition more reactive. We are always practicing with Molly to get her used to cafes/pubs. She can go to quieter places for shorter visits but doesn't do great with longer visits or places with too many other dogs. 

## Grass eating
Molly often tries to eat grass. We discourage this, but it doesn't necessarily mean that something is wrong, as it might for other dogs.

## Going off leash
We do off-leash exercise with Molly in open areas far from roads and without too many other dogs. Because of the issues described below, please avoid contexts with too many other dogs, like busy or enclosed dog parks. If you are unsure, it is safest to just do off-leash play in the garden. 

## Other behaviours

Sometimes at the end of a walk if Molly is over-stimulated or doesn't want to go home she will stop listening to commands and start acting up (yes, like a small child). When she flips in to this mode she will do things like:

* **Puddles** Molly doesn't like to swim but she will happily jump in a puddle
* **Recall** Molly comes on command, unless there is something more interesting do do which is about 25% of the time
* **Protest rolling** Instead of leaving the park Molly will stop, drop, and roll.
* **Chase me** Instead of leaving the park Molly will run away with her ball or a stick.

If Molly flips into this disobedient mode the best thing to do is (i) ignore her if she is running away from you; (ii) get her on leash; and (iii) use a treat or a ball to
encourage her to start moving.
