Molly is a beautiful four-year-old Bordoodle dog. A cross between a poodle and a border collie, she is very intelligent, loving and full of character. She needs a moderate amount of exercise and brain work (40-60 minutes) every day and otherwise she is very happy chilling at home and being close to her people. On the outside she is all doodle but her temperament is much more on the border collie side so she is not often interested in playing with other dog and is happier being with her people and having a few jobs to do. You will love getting to know this little doggie!
